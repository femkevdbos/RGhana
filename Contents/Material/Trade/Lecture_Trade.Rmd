# Trade Data
## Which data do we have?

- Before 2013:
  - ...
- Since 2020 (Complete data from June onwards)
  - ICUMS: Integrated Customs Management System

## How do we use this data? (Part 1)
<ol>
<li> Extract data from ICUMS
    <ul>
    <li> Issue = Many different sheets in Excel </li>
    </ul>
<li> Make new Excel files where we merge the sheets together
    <ul>
    <li> Either manually add Excel sheets together </li>
    <li> Manual errors!! We do not want to do this </li>
    <li> Now we also use a Stata code for this </li>
    <li> Peter has written an R code for this </li>
    <li> Which we will discuss!! </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
    
## How do we use this data? (Part 2)
<ol start=3>
<li> We load the Excel files into Eurotrace
    <ul>
    <li> Issue = maximum number of rows, could drop data (65,000) </li>
    <li> Maybe other issues </li>
    <li> We are working on comparing what we put into Eurotrace and what we retrieve from it </li>
    <li>For example check total imports and total exports, as well as specific commodities </li>
    </ul>
<li> Now currently you extract our trade data from Eurotrace, and send it to external (or internal) parties 
   <ul>
   <li> Issue = We are fully reliant on Eurotrace </li>
   </ul>
<li> NEW: We could reformat the raw ICUMS data ourselves, to not have to rely on Eurotrace and fully understand every step we take in manipulating the data.
</ol>
# A lot to discuss these two days!

## Step 2: Reformatting ICUMS data

- ICUMS: many different sheets
- We want to append the sheets to each other
  - While making sure that we do not have more than 65,000 rows per sheet
- Using R Code 
  - Prevents us from making manual errors!
  - Saves a lot of time as well :)

Now let us discuss the R Code to do this.

# Discuss the reformatting of the ICUMS data R code

# Next step

## Step 5: Cleaning and analysing ICUMS data

- We do not want to have to rely on Eurotrace to export our trade data
  - If Eurotrace is slow
  - If Eurotrace is suddenly down
  - We want to know what exactly happens to the data
    - Possibly some HS codes are not recognized by Eurotrace, causing issues
- If Eurotrace works perfectly:
  - Then our outcomes should be exactly the same as the Eurotrace output
    - For example the total imports, and total exports
    - Even when split up in HS codes or countries
    - These are things we need to check!! = work in progress
